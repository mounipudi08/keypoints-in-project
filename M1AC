So in short, ::before is used here to add a label automatically, making the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to manage. 
With ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ"></span>
Rendered as:
ログインユーザ：
Without ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ">ログインユーザ：</span>
You’d have to manually write the label inside the HTML every time.
What is opacity in CSS?
opacity controls how transparent or see-through an element is.

opacity: 1 → Fully visible (100% solid)

opacity: 0.5 → 50% transparent

opacity: 0 → Invisible
