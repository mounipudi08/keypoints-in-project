So in short, ::before is used here to add a label automatically, making the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to manage. 
With ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ"></span>
Rendered as:
ログインユーザ：
Without ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ">ログインユーザ：</span>
You’d have to manually write the label inside the HTML every time.
What is opacity in CSS?
opacity controls how transparent or see-through an element is.

opacity: 1 → Fully visible (100% solid)

opacity: 0.5 → 50% transparent

opacity: 0 → Invisible

🔍 What does display: inline do?
When an element has display: inline, it behaves like a piece of text:

✅ Characteristics:
Does not start on a new line
➤ It flows with surrounding text.

Respects width and height?
❌ Nope! You can’t control width or height on inline elements — those values are ignored.

Padding & margin?

Vertical padding/margin (top/bottom): Often ignored or not fully applied.

Horizontal padding/margin (left/right): Works.

Takes up only as much space as its content needs.

🧱 Examples:
HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="border: 1px solid red; display: inline;">
  Inline Box
</div>
<div style="border: 1px solid blue; display: inline;">
  Another Box
</div>
✅ Output: These boxes will appear side by side, like text:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[Inline Box][Another Box]
❌ Why you don’t use inline when...
You want to set a custom width/height

You want vertical padding/margin to apply

You want an element to act like a box or container

✅ When to use inline
You’re styling text-level elements like <span>, <a>, <strong>, etc.

You want something to flow naturally with text (like adding an icon or label)

🧱 Block elements
Always start on a new line.

Take full width (as wide as possible, left to right).

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <hr>, <ul>, <li>, etc.

👉 Think of them like big boxes stacked vertically.

✏️ Inline elements
Do not start a new line.

Only take up as much width as needed.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <button>, etc.

👉 Think of them like words inside a sentence — sitting next to each other.

📸 Simple visual:

HTML Element	Behavior
<div>	Block (new line, full width)
<hr>	Block (new line, separator line)
<span>	Inline (no new line)
<button>	Inline (sits beside spans)
💡 In your case:
<hr> is a block element → it forces a line break. (that's why the line and ヘルプ button go far apart!)

<span> is inline → it stays in the same line.

That’s why I told you: replace <hr> with <span> for the vertical

Alright!
Here's what display: inline-flex; means:

inline-flex makes the element behave like an inline element (so it flows inside text or next to other inline elements).

At the same time, it becomes a flex container, meaning its children can be arranged using flex properties (flex-direction, justify-content, etc.).

In simple words:
It doesn't take the whole line (unlike flex which acts like a block by default).

But inside, it still behaves like a flexbox (you can control the layout of the children).

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="display: inline-flex; gap: 10px;">
  <button>Button 1</button>
  <button>Button 2</button>
</div>
<span>Next to buttons</span>

Good question! Let’s break down display: inline-block; simply:

inline-block makes the element flow like inline elements (it sits next to other elements, not breaking into a new line).

But it can have width and height set (unlike normal inline elements).

In short:
inline = can't set width/height easily, flows with text

block = starts on a new line, can set width/height

inline-block = flows like inline, but behaves like block (you can set width/height)

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 100px; background: lightblue;">
  Box 1
</div>
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 100px; background: lightgreen;">
  Box 2
</div>
✅ These two boxes will sit side-by-side, not stacked.

Compared to inline-flex:
inline-block just holds normal content (no flex magic inside).

inline-flex arranges child elements with flexbox rules inside.

Is there any possiblility i don't want scroll bar when i can see the screen 
design fully , i want scroll bar when i am not see screen design fully
when i am using only overflow:auto the scroll bar is visible when i am able to see full screen design(maximize screen)

Ahh, I understand your problem now — you're saying:

Even when you maximize the screen and can see all the content,

The scrollbar is still visible with just overflow: auto;.

👉 You want the scrollbar to appear only when the content really overflows, otherwise no scrollbar at all.

This usually happens because of small reasons like:

Some small margin, padding, or border on the body or html.

The element (.wrapper) is slightly taller or wider than the viewport (even 1px!).

vh unit issues (like height: 100vh not perfectly matching screen size because of browser toolbars, especially on mobile or Mac).

How to fix it properly:
✅ 1. Make sure html and body are perfectly 100% height and no margin:

css
Copy
Edit
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: hidden; /* Important to avoid double scrollbars */
}
✅ 2. Then for your .wrapper, do:

css
Copy
Edit
.wrapper {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: auto; /* This will now behave correctly */
}


overflow: auto	Scrollbar appears if needed
overflow: scroll	Scrollbar always shown
overflow: hidden	Content hidden if overflowed
overflow: visible or initial	Content overflows freely (default)

Of course! Let’s go through your CSS step-by-step:

css
Copy code
div.m-d-table {
    width: 100%;
    display: table;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    margin: 0;
}
What each line means:
Line	Meaning
width: 100%;	The div takes up 100% of its parent’s width.
display: table;	This makes the div behave like an HTML <table>, not a normal block element.
border-collapse: collapse;	If there are any "table-like borders" inside, they will collapse together (no double borders).
margin: 0;	Removes any outside spacing around the div.
In simple words:
You are styling a <div> to act like a table.

It stretches full width.

If you add "rows" and "cells" (using display: table-row, display: table-cell on children), they will behave just like a real <table>.

Borders between cells will merge instead of being separated.

Small Example:
html
Copy code
<div class="m-d-table">
  <div style="display: table-row;">
    <div style="display: table-cell; border: 1px solid black;">Row 1, Cell 1</div>
    <div style="display: table-cell; border: 1px solid black;">Row 1, Cell 2</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: table-row;">
    <div style="display: table-cell; border: 1px solid black;">Row 2, Cell 1</div>
    <div style="display: table-cell; border: 1px solid black;">Row 2, Cell 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
✅ Here, even though it's made of <div>s, it behaves like a real table!

Why use div as table instead of <table>?

More flexible for styling with CSS.

Easier to integrate with other layouts like Flexbox/Grid.

Good for dynamic data where you build "table-like" structures manually.

Awesome! Let's do a clear and easy comparison between display: table and display: flex:

📋 display: table
The parent (div.m-d-table) behaves like a <table>.

Children must have display: table-row (like <tr>) and display: table-cell (like <td>).

Layout is strict: rows and cells align automatically (like real tables).

Widths are shared naturally, height adjusts based on tallest cell in a row.

Harder to "wrap" elements (no flexible wrapping like Flexbox).

✅ Good for: table-like structures where you want automatic column and row alignment without much CSS.

📋 display: flex
The parent becomes a flex container.

Children are flex items that can move, stretch, shrink easily.

Very flexible:

Align horizontally (flex-direction: row) or vertically (flex-direction: column).

Easy wrapping with flex-wrap: wrap.

Full control over spacing (gap), alignment (justify-content, align-items).

You manually control size and spacing.

✅ Good for: modern layouts like menus, cards, responsive grids, toolbars, etc.

display: table-row-group
It makes the element behave like a <tbody> in a normal HTML <table>.

It's usually used inside a display: table container.

It groups table rows (table-row) together.

Does not show visually different by itself, but helps structure complex tables better.

Now let’s clearly understand what's happening with your <div class="m-d-row m-d-col-span">.

🧠 What is happening?
When you add the m-d-row m-d-col-span class:

The layout becomes cleaner (the boxes are more aligned like a proper "row" and "columns").

It looks more like a full-width section with better height matching across cells.

When you remove that class:

The cells lose that organized row structure.

Some borders appear misaligned or broken.

🔥 What does m-d-row m-d-col-span probably mean?
m-d-row

Makes the container behave like a row (display: table-row or display: flex row).

Ensures that child elements line up horizontally, like a table row or flexbox row.

m-d-col-span

Likely allows this div to span across multiple columns.

Maybe it sets the width: 100% or grid-column: span X if you are using a grid system.

It ensures the div is treated as one full-width block instead of breaking into smaller pieces.

📷 Visual quick explanation:
Class Status	Behavior
❌ No m-d-row m-d-col-span	Normal div behavior → no structure, messy borders
✅ With m-d-row m-d-col-span	Acts like a proper table row → clean alignment, proper border merging


Good question! Let’s break it down super simply:

📋 What does the title attribute do?
In your code:

html
Copy code
<span class="lbヘルプアイコン" title="共用先の装置を入力してください。">
</span>
✅ The title="共用先の装置を入力してください。" is tooltip text.

👉 When the user hovers their mouse over this <span>,
a small pop-up box appears showing:
「共用先の装置を入力してください。」
(Translation: "Please enter the shared destination device.")

It means placing content in the middle between the top and bottom inside its container.

Not stuck at the top,
Not stuck at the bottom,
Exactly at the center vertically.

 What white-space: nowrap; means
✅ It tells the browser:

"Do not break the text into a new line, even if it's very long."

✅ Keep all the text on one single line — no matter how long it becomes.

Method	Meaning	Displayed on screen?
Using <span> (like lb標準_マルチライン_左詰)	Real visible text inside HTML	✅ YES, user can see
Using name="備考" attribute on <div>	HTML attribute (for backend/JavaScript)	❌ NO, not directly visible

margin: 0;	Removes all the default outside space around the body. No outer margin.
padding: 0;	Removes all the inside space inside the body. No inner padding.
height: 100%;	Makes the body’s height 100% of the viewport (browser window height).
overflow: hidden;	Hides any scrollbars. Even if content goes outside the body, no scrollbars will appear.
