So in short, ::before is used here to add a label automatically, making the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to manage. 
With ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ"></span>
Rendered as:
ログインユーザ：
Without ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ">ログインユーザ：</span>
You’d have to manually write the label inside the HTML every time.
What is opacity in CSS?
opacity controls how transparent or see-through an element is.

opacity: 1 → Fully visible (100% solid)

opacity: 0.5 → 50% transparent

opacity: 0 → Invisible

🔍 What does display: inline do?
When an element has display: inline, it behaves like a piece of text:

✅ Characteristics:
Does not start on a new line
➤ It flows with surrounding text.

Respects width and height?
❌ Nope! You can’t control width or height on inline elements — those values are ignored.

Padding & margin?

Vertical padding/margin (top/bottom): Often ignored or not fully applied.

Horizontal padding/margin (left/right): Works.

Takes up only as much space as its content needs.

🧱 Examples:
HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="border: 1px solid red; display: inline;">
  Inline Box
</div>
<div style="border: 1px solid blue; display: inline;">
  Another Box
</div>
✅ Output: These boxes will appear side by side, like text:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[Inline Box][Another Box]
❌ Why you don’t use inline when...
You want to set a custom width/height

You want vertical padding/margin to apply

You want an element to act like a box or container

✅ When to use inline
You’re styling text-level elements like <span>, <a>, <strong>, etc.

You want something to flow naturally with text (like adding an icon or label)

🧱 Block elements
Always start on a new line.

Take full width (as wide as possible, left to right).

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <hr>, <ul>, <li>, etc.

👉 Think of them like big boxes stacked vertically.

✏️ Inline elements
Do not start a new line.

Only take up as much width as needed.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <button>, etc.

👉 Think of them like words inside a sentence — sitting next to each other.

📸 Simple visual:

HTML Element	Behavior
<div>	Block (new line, full width)
<hr>	Block (new line, separator line)
<span>	Inline (no new line)
<button>	Inline (sits beside spans)
💡 In your case:
<hr> is a block element → it forces a line break. (that's why the line and ヘルプ button go far apart!)

<span> is inline → it stays in the same line.

That’s why I told you: replace <hr> with <span> for the vertica
