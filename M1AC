So in short, ::before is used here to add a label automatically, making the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to manage. 
With ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ"></span>
Rendered as:
ログインユーザ：
Without ::before:
<span class="lbヘッダー_ログインユーザ">ログインユーザ：</span>
You’d have to manually write the label inside the HTML every time.
What is opacity in CSS?
opacity controls how transparent or see-through an element is.

opacity: 1 → Fully visible (100% solid)

opacity: 0.5 → 50% transparent

opacity: 0 → Invisible

🔍 What does display: inline do?
When an element has display: inline, it behaves like a piece of text:

✅ Characteristics:
Does not start on a new line
➤ It flows with surrounding text.

Respects width and height?
❌ Nope! You can’t control width or height on inline elements — those values are ignored.

Padding & margin?

Vertical padding/margin (top/bottom): Often ignored or not fully applied.

Horizontal padding/margin (left/right): Works.

Takes up only as much space as its content needs.

🧱 Examples:
HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="border: 1px solid red; display: inline;">
  Inline Box
</div>
<div style="border: 1px solid blue; display: inline;">
  Another Box
</div>
✅ Output: These boxes will appear side by side, like text:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[Inline Box][Another Box]
❌ Why you don’t use inline when...
You want to set a custom width/height

You want vertical padding/margin to apply

You want an element to act like a box or container

✅ When to use inline
You’re styling text-level elements like <span>, <a>, <strong>, etc.

You want something to flow naturally with text (like adding an icon or label)

🧱 Block elements
Always start on a new line.

Take full width (as wide as possible, left to right).

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <hr>, <ul>, <li>, etc.

👉 Think of them like big boxes stacked vertically.

✏️ Inline elements
Do not start a new line.

Only take up as much width as needed.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <button>, etc.

👉 Think of them like words inside a sentence — sitting next to each other.

📸 Simple visual:

HTML Element	Behavior
<div>	Block (new line, full width)
<hr>	Block (new line, separator line)
<span>	Inline (no new line)
<button>	Inline (sits beside spans)
💡 In your case:
<hr> is a block element → it forces a line break. (that's why the line and ヘルプ button go far apart!)

<span> is inline → it stays in the same line.

That’s why I told you: replace <hr> with <span> for the vertical

Alright!
Here's what display: inline-flex; means:

inline-flex makes the element behave like an inline element (so it flows inside text or next to other inline elements).

At the same time, it becomes a flex container, meaning its children can be arranged using flex properties (flex-direction, justify-content, etc.).

In simple words:
It doesn't take the whole line (unlike flex which acts like a block by default).

But inside, it still behaves like a flexbox (you can control the layout of the children).

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="display: inline-flex; gap: 10px;">
  <button>Button 1</button>
  <button>Button 2</button>
</div>
<span>Next to buttons</span>

Good question! Let’s break down display: inline-block; simply:

inline-block makes the element flow like inline elements (it sits next to other elements, not breaking into a new line).

But it can have width and height set (unlike normal inline elements).

In short:
inline = can't set width/height easily, flows with text

block = starts on a new line, can set width/height

inline-block = flows like inline, but behaves like block (you can set width/height)

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 100px; background: lightblue;">
  Box 1
</div>
<div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 100px; background: lightgreen;">
  Box 2
</div>
✅ These two boxes will sit side-by-side, not stacked.

Compared to inline-flex:
inline-block just holds normal content (no flex magic inside).

inline-flex arranges child elements with flexbox rules inside.
